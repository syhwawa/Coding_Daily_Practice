Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:

Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
Example 2:

Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        start = -1 
        max = 0 # max = i -start, if s = ''=> return 1
        d = {}
        
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] in d and d[s[i]] > start:
                start = d[s[i]] #update the index of same char 
            else:
                if i - start > max: #update max
                    max = i - start
            d[s[i]] = i
        return max

In a binary tree, the root node is at depth 0, and children of each depth k node are at depth k+1.

Two nodes of a binary tree are cousins if they have the same depth, but have different parents.

We are given the root of a binary tree with unique values, and the values x and y of two different nodes in the tree.

Return true if and only if the nodes corresponding to the values x and y are cousins.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [1,2,3,4], x = 4, y = 3
Output: false
Example 2:


Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4,null,5], x = 5, y = 4
Output: true
Example 3:



Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4], x = 2, y = 3
Output: false
 

Note:

The number of nodes in the tree will be between 2 and 100.
Each node has a unique integer value from 1 to 100.

Solution 1:
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isCousins(self, root: TreeNode, x: int, y: int) -> bool:
        if not root:
            return False
        current = [root]
        while current:
            next_level, next_val = [], []
            for node in current:
                if node.left and node.right:
                    if (node.left.val == x and node.right.val == y) or (node.right.val == x and node.left.val ==y):
                        return False
                if node.left:
                    next_level.append(node.left)
                    next_val.append(node.left.val)
                if node.right:
                    next_level.append(node.right)
                    next_val.append(node.right.val)
            
            if x in next_val and y in next_val:
                return True
            if x not in next_val and y not in next_val:
                current = next_level
            else:
                return False 
        return False

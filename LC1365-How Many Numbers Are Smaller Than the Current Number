Leecode 1365. How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number
"Moe doesn't like this question"
Given the array nums, 
for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. 
That is, for each nums[i] 
you have to count the number of valid j's such that j != i and nums[j] < nums[i].
Return the answer in an array.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [8,1,2,2,3]
Output: [4,0,1,1,3]
Explanation: 
For nums[0]=8 there exist four smaller numbers than it (1, 2, 2 and 3). 
For nums[1]=1 does not exist any smaller number than it.
For nums[2]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). 
For nums[3]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). 
For nums[4]=3 there exist three smaller numbers than it (1, 2 and 2).
Example 2:
Input: nums = [6,5,4,8]
Output: [2,1,0,3]


class Solution:
    def smallerNumbersThanCurrent(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        a = 0
        b = []
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(len(nums)):
                if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                    a += 1
            b.append(a)
            a = 0
        return b

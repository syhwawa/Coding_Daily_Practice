Problem Statement #
We are given an array containing ‘n’ distinct numbers taken from the range 0 to ‘n’. Since the array has only ‘n’ numbers out of the total ‘n+1’ numbers, find the missing number.

Example 1:

Input: [4, 0, 3, 1]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: [8, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6, 0, 1]
Output: 7

      nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]  # swap
    else:
      i += 1

  # find the first number missing from its index, that will be our required number

Given a binary tree, find the length of its diameter. The diameter of a tree is the number of nodes on the longest path between any two leaf nodes. 
The diameter of a tree may or may not pass through the root.
Note: You can always assume that there are at least two leaf nodes in the given tree.

class TreeNode:
  def __init__(self, val, left=None, right=None):
    self.val = val
    self.left = left
    self.right = right


class TreeDiameter:

  def __init__(self):
    self.treeDiameter = 0

  def find_diameter(self, root):
    self.calculate_height(root)
    return self.treeDiameter

  def calculate_height(self, currentNode):
    if currentNode is None:
      return 0

    leftTreeHeight = self.calculate_height(currentNode.left)
    rightTreeHeight = self.calculate_height(currentNode.right)

    # diameter at the current node will be equal to the height of left subtree +
    # the height of right sub-trees + '1' for the current node
    diameter = leftTreeHeight + rightTreeHeight + 1

    # update the global tree diameter
    self.treeDiameter = max(self.treeDiameter, diameter)

    # height of the current node will be equal to the maximum of the heights of
    # left or right subtrees plus '1' for the current node
    return max(leftTreeHeight, rightTreeHeight) + 1


def main():
  treeDiameter = TreeDiameter()
  root = TreeNode(1)
  root.left = TreeNode(2)
  root.right = TreeNode(3)
  root.left.left = TreeNode(4)
  root.right.left = TreeNode(5)
  root.right.right = TreeNode(6)
  print("Tree Diameter: " + str(treeDiameter.find_diameter(root)))
  root.left.left = None
  root.right.left.left = TreeNode(7)
  root.right.left.right = TreeNode(8)
  root.right.right.left = TreeNode(9)
  root.right.left.right.left = TreeNode(10)
  root.right.right.left.left = TreeNode(11)
  print("Tree Diameter: " + str(treeDiameter.find_diameter(root)))


main()

Time complexity #
The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(N), where ‘N’ is the total number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the fact that we traverse each node once.

Space complexity #
The space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) in the worst case. This space will be used to store the recursion stack. 
The worst case will happen when the given tree is a linked list (i.e., every node has only one child).

Get the highest answer rate question from a table survey_log with these columns: id, action, question_id, answer_id, q_num, timestamp.

id means user id; action has these kind of values: "show", "answer", "skip"; answer_id is not null when action column is "answer", while is null for "show" and "skip"; q_num is the numeral order of the question in current session.

Write a sql query to identify the question which has the highest answer rate.

Example:

Input:
```
+------+-----------+--------------+------------+-----------+------------+
| id   | action    | question_id  | answer_id  | q_num     | timestamp  |
+------+-----------+--------------+------------+-----------+------------+
| 5    | show      | 285          | null       | 1         | 123        |
| 5    | answer    | 285          | 124124     | 1         | 124        |
| 5    | show      | 369          | null       | 2         | 125        |
| 5    | skip      | 369          | null       | 2         | 126        |
+------+-----------+--------------+------------+-----------+------------+
```
Output:
```
+-------------+
| survey_log  |
+-------------+
|    285      |
+-------------+
```
Explanation:
question 285 has answer rate 1/1, while question 369 has 0/1 answer rate, so output 285.


```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT question_id AS survey_log FROM
(SELECT question_id, 
        SUM(IF(action='show', 1, 0)) AS num_show,
        SUM(IF(action='answer', 1, 0)) AS num_answer
 FROM survey_log GROUP BY question_id) AS t
ORDER BY (num_answer/num_show) DESC LIMIT 1;
```

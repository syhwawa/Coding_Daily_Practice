Several friends at a cinema ticket office would like to reserve consecutive available seats.
Can you help to query all the consecutive available seats order by the seat_id using the following cinema table?
| seat_id | free |
|---------|------|
| 1       | 1    |
| 2       | 0    |
| 3       | 1    |
| 4       | 1    |
| 5       | 1    |
 

Your query should return the following result for the sample case above.
 

| seat_id |
|---------|
| 3       |
| 4       |
| 5       |
Note:
The seat_id is an auto increment int, and free is bool ('1' means free, and '0' means occupied.).
Consecutive available seats are more than 2(inclusive) seats consecutively available.

```SQL
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select distinct(c1.seat_id) 
from cinema c1 join cinema c2
on    abs(c2.seat_id-c1.seat_id)=1
where c1.free=1 and c2.free=1
order by c1.seat_id
```
